# IBM_Data_Science_Certificate
Labs performed while completing the IBM Data Science Certificate, a collection of 9 courses meant to prepare someone for work in data science
The relevant courses, ie. courses that have provided hands-on lab work, have been shared in this repository and can be accessed through the various branches
Each branch represents a different course in the certificate
Some of the earlier courses in the certificate have not been included in this repository as they did not have me writing my own code they were more so familiarize oneself with thinking about data science)
